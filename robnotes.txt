Halp

 - Thread safety of opening new readers on change


 - Perform flushing per index properly via the API
 - Read checkpoint on start-up of each reader
 - Open all writers/readers/indexes on start-up (well, writers anyway)

 - We shouldn't allow projections to write to indexes they don't own
    - Consider storing projection name in the index as a system doc
    - Consider validating whether an index exists ahead of time so we can fault projection

Building Clucene

  - Boost as a dependency - Download as well?

Building JsonCPP
  - Another dependency!! :(
  - It's at least Cmake again
